# 🧪 NeoBrowse-Lite

NeoBrowse-Lite is a basic browser prototype made for testing UI ideas. Built with **Python, QSS, HTML, and CSS**. It has tabs, dark mode, and some internal link hijacking. Mostly experimental, kinda goofy, and not very polished.

## ⚙️ Features
- Tabbed browsing (barebones)
- Dark mode toggle
- Internal link hijacking
- Theme switching (sort of works)
- Minimal UI (but not very pretty)

## 🧱 Tech Stack
- Python (PyQt5)
- QSS (for styling)
- HTML & CSS (for embedded content and testing)

## 🚀 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Micronux-PRO/neobrowse-lite
cd neobrowse-lite
python main.py
